              In this demo, MedGemma functions as an AI agent designed to assist in pre-visit information
              collection. It will interact with the patient agent to gather relevant data.
              To provide additional context, MedGemma also has access to information from the patient's EHR (in FHIR format).
              However, MedGemma is not provided the specific diagnois ({selectedCondition}).
              MedGemma's goal is to gather details about symptoms, relevant history,
              and current concerns to generate a comprehensive pre-visit report.

              In this simulation, the patient agent does not know their diagnosis,
              but is experiencing related symptoms and concerns that can be shared during the interview. 
              To simulate a real-world situation with confounding information, additional information unrelated to the presenting condition has also been provided.
