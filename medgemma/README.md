# AppointReady: Simulated Pre-visit Intake Demo built using MedGemma

Healthcare providers often seek efficient ways to gather comprehensive patient information before appointments. This demo illustrates how MedGemma could be used in an application to streamline pre-visit information collection and utilization. 

The demonstration first asks questions to gather pre-visit information.
After it has identified and collected relevant information, the demo application generates a pre-visit report using both collected and health record information (stored as FHIR resources for this demonstration). This type of intelligent pre-visit report can help providers be more efficient and effective while also providing an improved experience for patients compared to traditional intake forms.

At the conclusion of the demo, you can view an evaluation of the pre-visit report which provides additional insights into the quality of the demonstrated capabilities. For this evaluation, MedGemma is provided the patient's reference diagnosis, allowing MedGemma to create a self-evaluation report highlighting strengths as well as areas for improvement.

## Technical Architecture
This application is composed of several key components:

*   **Frontend**: A web interface built with React that provides the user interface for the chat and report visualization.
*   **Backend**: A Python server built with Gunicorn/Flask that handles the application logic. It communicates with the LLMs, manages the conversation flow, and generates the final pre-visit report.
*   **API called**:
    *   **MedGemma**: Acts as the clinical assistant, asking relevant questions and summarizing information.
    *   **Gemini**: Role-plays as the patient, providing responses based on a predefined scenario.
    *   **Gemini TTS**: Generative text-to-speech model.
*   **Deployment**: The entire application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Running the Demo Locally

To run this demo on your own machine, you'll need to have Docker installed.

### Prerequisites
*   Docker
*   Git
*   A Google Cloud project with the Vertex AI API enabled.

### Setup & Configuration
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/google/appoint-ready
    cd appoint-ready
    ```

2.  **Configure environment variables:**
    This project uses an `env.list` file for configuration, which is passed to Docker. Create this file in the root directory.
    ```ini
    # env.list
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-token"
    GENERATE_SPEECH=false or true
    GCP_MEDGEMMA_ENDPOINT=medgemma vertex ai endpoint 
    GCP_MEDGEMMA_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY="service-account-key json"  
    ```

    GEMINI_API_KEY: Key can be generated via [aistudio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
    GENERATE_SPEECH: Should the demo generate speech not found in cache. Default is false.
    GCP_MEDGEMMA_ENDPOINT: Deploy MedGemma via [Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/medgemma).

### Execution
1.  **Build and run the Docker containers:**
    ```bash
    run_local.sh
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**
    Once the containers are running, you can access the demo in your web browser at `http://localhost:[PORT]`. (e.g., `http://localhost:7860`).

# Models used
